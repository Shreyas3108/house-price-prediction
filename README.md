Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

The tutorial and write up for the code can be found here

If you recently are learning machine learning and don't know what model and parameters to use, you can use AutomML tools like TPOT https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot.

For this dataset, TPOT suggest to use a model which have an accurancy=0.90930017, see files:
- housesalesTPOT.py which have the training model instructions. 
- TpotResultst.py: results generated from tpot
- TestNewModel.py: testing the suggested model.


Thank you
